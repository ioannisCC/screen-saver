# screen-saver

An .NET Windows Forms application was developed using Visual Studio 2022. The user is asked to input an integer, and based on that number, a corresponding number of balls (forms) are displayed on the screen. When the balls hit the edges of the screen, they bounce off.

note: The balls (forms) are hide from taskbar, so in oreder to terminate application you have to use Ctrl + Alt buttons.
